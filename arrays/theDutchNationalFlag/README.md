### 2nd problem statement

The Famous Dutch Flag Problem

Lets assume: RED:0, WHITE:1, BLUE:2
For example you have an input array like below

A: 0 1 2 0 1 2 1 0 2

Sorting ......

Resulting A: 0 0 0 1 1 1 2 2 2

Steps
* Learn about recursive functions and try basic factorial problem.
* Learn how quick sort algorithm works and understand it. Time complexity of this           algorithm is O(nlogn)
* Think about the problem statement and figure out the optimized way. 
* You can use O(n), where n is the length of an array. 
* You are required to solve it without allocating additional storage.
* The provided solution has O(n) time complexity

First try out on your own then see the solution.
